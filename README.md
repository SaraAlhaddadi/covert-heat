# 🌡️ covert-heat

## برنامج للتحويل من درجات حرارة مئوية إلى درجات بالفهرنهايت

This repository contains a simple Python program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

## Usage

To use this program, follow the steps below:

1. 🔗 Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaraAlhaddadi/covert-heat.git
   ```


🖥️ Open the command line or terminal and navigate to the project directory.

▶️ Run the convert_heat.py file:
```bash

    python convert_heat.py
 ```

🌡️ The program will prompt you to enter a temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.

📝 After entering the temperature, the program will display the converted temperature.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the program:
Example 1: Celsius to Fahrenheit
```
Enter the temperature in Celsius: 20
20 degrees Celsius = 68.0 degrees Fahrenheit
```
Example 2: Fahrenheit to Celsius
```
Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: 48
48 degrees Fahrenheit = 8.88888888888889 degrees Celsius
```
The program supports both English and Arabic input.

أمثلة

فيما يلي بعض الأمثلة على كيفية استخدام البرنامج:
المثال 1: من السيليزية إلى الفهرنهايت

```
أدخل درجة الحرارة بالسيليزية: 20
20 درجة مئوية = 68.0 درجة فهرنهايت
```
المثال 2: من الفهرنهايت إلى السيليزية
```
أدخل درجة الحرارة بالفهرنهايت: 48
48 درجة فهرنهايت = 8.88888888888889 درجة مئوية
```
